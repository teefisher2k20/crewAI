**Learning:** Providing immediate, actionable "Next Steps" after a long or complex CLI operation (like project creation) significantly reduces cognitive load and improves the user's flow. Using visual delimiters like `rich.panel.Panel` makes this information stand out and feel like a distinct part of the UI.
**Action:** Always consider what the user's *very next* action will be after a command finishes, and provide the exact commands needed to perform it in a clearly visible format.
