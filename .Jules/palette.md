**Learning:** After a successful project creation (crew or flow), users often feel a "moment of pause" wondering what to do next. Providing a consistent, visually distinct (Rich panel) "Next Steps" guide with clear commands (cd, install, run) reduces friction and improves the onboarding experience.
**Action:** Always include a "Next Steps" or "What's Next" section after any initialization or creation command in the CLI.
