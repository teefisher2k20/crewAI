**Learning:** Users often feel lost after a "successful" project initialization if they aren't given clear immediate next steps. Providing a visually distinct "Next Steps" panel with the exact commands needed to navigate, install, and run the project significantly reduces friction and improves the "time to first run" experience.
**Action:** Always include a 'Next Steps' panel or similar guidance after initialization or complex setup commands in CLI tools.
