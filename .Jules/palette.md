## 2025-05-15 - "Next Steps" pattern for CLI creation commands
**Learning:** Providing immediate, actionable "Next steps" after a successful creation command significantly reduces user friction and helps onboard new users by showing them exactly what to do next without them having to refer back to documentation.
**Action:** Always include a styled "Next Steps" panel after any CLI command that creates a new project or significant structure, guiding the user to the next logical actions (e.g., cd into directory, install dependencies, run).
