## 2025-05-15 - CLI "Next Steps" Guidance Pattern
**Learning:** Users often experience a "now what?" moment after a CLI project initialization command finishes successfully. Providing clear, actionable next steps in a visually distinct panel (using `rich.Panel`) significantly improves the onboarding experience and reduces friction for first-time users.
**Action:** Always include a "Next Steps" section after successful resource creation or project initialization in CLI tools, detailing the minimal set of commands needed to get started (e.g., `cd`, `install`, `run`).
