## 2025-05-15 - [CLI "Next Steps" Pattern]
**Learning:** The "Next Steps" pattern is a highly effective CLI micro-UX improvement that reduces cognitive load by telling the user exactly what to do next. Using Rich panels makes this information stand out visually and provides a clear transition from setup to usage.
**Action:** Always consider adding "Next Steps" guidance after project creation or environment setup commands in CLI tools to guide the user's first interactions.
